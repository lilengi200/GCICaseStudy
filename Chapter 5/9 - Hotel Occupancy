    //Write a program that calculates the occupany rate for a hotel. The program should 
    //start by asking the user how many floors the hotel has. A loop should then iterate 
    //once for each floor. in each iteration, the loop should ask the user for the number of 
    //rooms on the floor and how many of them are occupied. after all the iterations, the
    //programs should display how many rooms the hotel has, how many are occupied, how many 
    //are unoccupied, and the percetage of rooms that are occupied. the percetage may be 
    //calculated by dividing the number of rooms occupied by the number of rooms. note its 
    //traditional that most hotels do not have a 13th floor. the loop in this program should
    //skip the entire 13th floor iteration. do no accept a value less than 1 for the number 
    //of floors, number less than 10 for number of rooms.
