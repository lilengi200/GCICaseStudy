    //which is 60% of the property's actual value. if an ace land is valued at $10,000, 
    //its assessment value is $6000. the property tax is then 0.64 cents for each $100 of 
    //the assessment value. the tax for the acre assessed at $6000 will be $38.40. 
    //Write a program that asks for the actual value of a piece of Property and displays 
    //the assesment value and property tax.
    
    //& 3.14 - Senior Citizen Property Tax - Coded by Quanysha Jones
    //Madison county provides a $5,000 homeowner exemption for its senior citizens. 
    //for example, if a senior;s house is valued at $158,000 its assessed value would be 
    //$94,800, as explained above. however, he would only pay tax on $89,800. At last year's 
    //tax rate of $2.64 for each $100 of assessed value, the property tax would be $2,370.72.
    //in addiction to the tax break, senior citizens are allowed to pay their propertytax in 
    //four equal payments. the quarterly payment due on this property would be $592.68. 
    //Write a program that asks the user to input the actual value of a piece of property 
    //and the current tax rate for each $100 of assed value. the program should then 
    //calculate and report how much annual property tax a senior homeowner will be charged 
    //for this property and what the quarterly tac bill will be.
