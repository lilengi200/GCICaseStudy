    //write a program that can be used as a math tutor for a young student. 
    //the program should display two random numbers that are to be added. the program 
    //should wait for the student to enter answer. if the answer is correct, a message of 
    //congratulations should be printed. if the answer is incorrect, a message should be 
    //printed showing the correct answer.
