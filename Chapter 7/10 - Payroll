    //seven doubles to hold each employee's hourly pay rate. wages: an array of seven doubles 
    //to hold each employee's gross wages. the program should relate the data in each array

    //enter that employe's hours and pay rate. it should then calculate the gross wages for 
    //that employe( hours times pay rate) and store them in the wages array. after the data 
    //has been entered for all employees, the program should display each employee's
