    //different types of salsa: mild, medium, sweet, hot, and zesty. The program should use

    //and an array of integers that holds the number of jars sold during the past month for each salsa type. 
    //the salsa names should be stored usong an initialization list at the time the name 
    //array is created. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of jars 
    //sold for each type. Once this sales data has been entered, the program should produce 
    //a report that displays sales for each salsa type, titak sakes, and the names of the 
    //highest selling and lowest selling products. Do not accecpt negative values for 
    //numers of jars sold.
