    //leave it alone to draw interest for the next 10 years. At the end of 10 years you would 
    //like to have $10,000 in the account. how much do you need to deposit today to make that 
    //happen? you can use the following formula, which is known as the present value formula , 
    //to find out: P = F/(1+r)^n . the terms in the formula are as follows: P is the present 
    //value or the amount that you need to deposit. F is the future value the you want in the 
    //account. (in this case, F is $10,000.) R is the annual interest rate. n is the number of 
    //years that you plan to let the money sit in the account. write a program that has a 
    //function name presentvalue that performs this calculation. the function should accept the 
    //future value, which is the amount that you need to deposit today. demonstrate the function 
    //in a program that lets the user experiment with different values for the formula's term.
