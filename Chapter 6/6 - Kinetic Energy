    //in physics, an object that is in motion is said to have kinetic energy. the following 
    //formula can be used to determin a moving object's kinetic energy: KE = 0.5mv^2. 
    //the variables in the formula are as follows: KE is kinetic energy, m is the object's 
    //mass in kilograms, and v is the object's velocity, in meters per second. write a 
    //function named kineticEnergy that accepts an object's mass (in kilograms) and velocity 
    //(in meters per second) as argurment. the function should return the ammount of kinetic 
    //energy that the object has. demonstrate the function by calling it in a program that 
    //asks the user to enter values for mass and velocity.
